# citychoice
Figure out where you're going to live next. This is important to you now.

If I had to sum up my aim for this, it would be twofold: 
1. Prove to myself that I can build a functioning project. You do this by sharing it. 
2. Figure out places I can live in the future. 

Achieving both means I've done something well. Although you can never replace the feeling of being on the ground in a community, I have built a criteria that I care about as starting points for a decision to move. 

The way to run this bad boy is to download the CSV files along with the main cities.py file. The data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Results, some site called World Population Review, and Whole Foods. 

It only runs in command line interfaces right now. If I decide to add on, I'll add in a front end, and there are some ideas on how to make this actually dope, but we'll see. I'm on to another project now. 

It's short. It's silly. It's also kind of useful. 

love,
balos
